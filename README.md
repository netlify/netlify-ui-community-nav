# netlify-ui-community-nav

A web component for shared navigation on Community, Forums, Answers, Podcasts, Swag, and others.

* [**Demo**](https://netlify-ui-community-nav.netlify.app/demo.html)
* [Figma Designs](https://www.figma.com/file/D7YIl02a4P2W0LKur2Nxbw/Community-2.0---navigation?node-id=112%3A5&viewport=-849%2C-3011%2C1)

## Implementing

1. Add `nav.js` and `nav.css` to your siteâ€™s bundler.
2. Copy markup for the property (find the `<netlify-ui-community-nav>` in `demo.html`) and add to the top of the page (update the Customize sections)

The reason we embed markup inline inside of the web component here is for both progressive enhancement and performance reasons. The hamburger icon is also embedded inline to animate the transition when opened.
